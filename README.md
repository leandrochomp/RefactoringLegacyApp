# RefactoringLegacyApp test in C#

# Description
You are asked to refactor the project `LegacyService`. Assuming the logic is perfectly **sound**, you are asked to refactor and modernise the code base, as well as improve its performance if possible.

## Tasks

### Complete the test project

- It is important to note that the `LegacyService` is not test covered, thus it is essential to complete the tests to ensure refactoring working.

### Refactoring by applying clean code principles e.g. SOLID, KISS, DRY and YAGNI and applicable design patterns

- Ideally async/await pattern should be applied;

## Limitations

- You can change anything in the `LegacyService` except for the `CandidateDataAccess` class and its `AddCandidate` method. Both NEED to stay **static**
- Feel free to use you preferred Mock/Assertion libraries in the test projects.
